# EffectivePopulationGen
Lokta Volterra simulator for predator and prey models including effective population and mutation rate calulcations. Comensalism, competition, 
and mutualism are in development. These models generate a simulation of populations and then calculates the population census. 

The effective population of a species is then calculated based off the population census numbers. Effective population is the translation of 
census sizes of real populations into the size of an idealized population showing the same rate of loss of genetic diversity as the real population 
under study. 

Our model then calculates the mutation rates based off the effective population.Our theoretical models will then be compared to actual data from 
peer reviewed journals, which will show us how accurate our models are and give the scientific community more insight into effective population.
